# pig-latin_PYTHON
This was a quick project to get accustomed to the Python langauge and git

## Rules
If a word starts in a consonant, take that consonant, add it to the end, and then add "ay"
    * "hello" becomes "ellohay"
If a word starts in a vowel, just add "hay" to the end
    * "is" becomes "ishay"
<br />
This implementation DOES account for exclamations and possible word endings. This includes:
    * ".", "!", "?", "," ":", ";"
